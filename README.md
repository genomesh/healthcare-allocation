# Optimal Resource Allocation in Healthcare

This is a project exploring how to get the maximum utility from limited healthcare resources. Please see the project overview for more technical details.

## Main aims

1. Use rule-based systems to model patients and surgeries.
2. Implement the Gillespie algorithm to simulate the system.
3. Derive mass-action ODE's to model the system.
4. Compare the Gillespie algorithm and the mass-action ODE's. Perform a parameter study.
5. Compare different policies that hospitals could implement, discuss further implications
6. Fit models to real-world data, and evaluate real-world policies.
